# Ml-PROJECTS
This Repo consists of Machine learning projects:

Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning:
This project focuses on predicting whether a person is diabetic or not based on specific health metrics using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset that includes features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.
Rainfall prediction using Machine learning:
This project predicts rainfall based on meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and more. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze historical weather data and make predictions.
